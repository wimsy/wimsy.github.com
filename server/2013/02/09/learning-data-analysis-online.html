<h1 id='learning_data_analysis_online'>Learning Data Analysis Online</h1>

<p>Since early January, I&#8217;ve been taking an online course at <a href='http://coursera.org'>Coursera</a> called <a href='https://www.coursera.org/course/compmethods'>Computational Methods for Data Analysis</a>. This is my first experience with full-length online coursework (unless you count watching VHS tapes of lectures for an ill-conceived distance attempt at a masters in engineering).</p>

<p>So far, I&#8217;d say its been a good experience. Of course, it&#8217;s a good value, but I think I am gaining worthwhile knowledge. The course covers time-frequency analysis (<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform'>FFT</a>, <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelet'>wavelet</a>, etc.) and <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension_reduction'>dimensionally reduction</a> techniques (SVD, PCA, etc.) with practical examples from image processing, communications and physics.</p>

<p>The course is heavily <a href='http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/'>MATLAB</a>-based. I started out following along with <a href='http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/'>GNU Octave,</a> but decided around week 3 to attempt to do it all with Python&#8217;s math and science libraries (NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib). So, I have a running <a href='http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/interactive/htmlnotebook.html'>iPython notebook</a> replicating the readings&#8217; MATLAB examples in Python. I&#8217;ll probably attempt to publish it here or somewhere once the class is finished in March.</p>

<p>I learned a long time ago that I prefer to learn by reading and use lectures in a targeted way to clarify something I might not be getting. Coursera&#8217;s setup for this is actually quite good. The built-in video player has features to speed up playback, and lectures are broken in to 10-15 minute segments to easily jump to the info you seek.</p>

<p>My intention was to take a <a href='http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/index.htm'>refresher course in linear algebra</a> before I started this one, but I didn&#8217;t get it done. I think it definitely would have been helpful, but not necessary in my case. I think someone with no linear algebra would be a bit lost, but even my 20–year–old memories of matrix math seem to be serving here – so far.</p>

<p>In a past life I was actually a somewhat heavy MATLAB user for digital signal processing applications, so it&#8217;s nice to dust some of that thinking off (in a new language) and think about how I might use these tools on business data instead of digital wireless signals. Also, I&#8217;m becoming more and more enamored of iPython Notebook as I progress - to the point that I&#8217;ve searched writing all my Quantary posts with it.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m about halfway through the class, so I&#8217;ll come back with my final thoughts in six weeks or so, hopefully along with an impressive iPython notebook to show off what I did.</p>
