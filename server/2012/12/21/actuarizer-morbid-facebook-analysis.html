<h1 id='actuarize_to_creep_out_your_friends_with_actuarial_tables'>Actuarize to Creep Out Your Friends with Actuarial Tables</h1>

<p>So, now that we&#8217;ve all survived the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_phenomenon'>end of the world</a>, it feels like we could use a statistical discussion of our collective mortality. Right? No? Actually I&#8217;ve wanted to do this ever since I came across <a href='http://www.xkcd.com'>xkcd</a>&#8217;s <a href='http://blog.xkcd.com/2012/07/12/a-morbid-python-script/'>clever use of actuarial tables</a>. Also, I wanted an excuse to try out the <a href='https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/apis/'>Facebook Open Graph API</a>.</p>

<p>So, I&#8217;m going to use cold, hard statistics to tell my friends when they can expect to die. Not any particular friend, mind you, but some statistical sampling of them. I even worked with my friend <a href='https://github.com/scottlnorvell'>Scott</a> to whip up a little web app that anyone can do to get the same basic stats that xkcd pulled together.</p>

<h2 id='what_i_learned'>What I learned</h2>

<ul>
<li>I had my first ugly experience with <a href='https://developers.facebook.com/docs/howtos/login/login-for-desktop/'>Facebook&#8217;s OAuth process</a>. I&#8217;m not going to say that I exhausted it (or even learned what I was doing wrong) but it was painful nonetheless. I think if I ever get serious about using Facebook data, I&#8217;ll need to revisit this at length.</li>

<li>After my failed attempt at Facebook&#8217;s OAuth, I punted and chose to use <a href='http://www.temboo.com'>Temboo</a> to accomplish the login task. They provide the necessary callback URL that I found so challenging the first time around (the idea for a web app came later, so setting up a webpage seemed like overkill for some basic number crunching).</li>

<li>I used the standard <a href='https://github.com/pythonforfacebook/facebook-sdk/'>Facebook Python SDK</a> with <a href='https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/fql/'>FQL</a> for the data requests themselves.</li>

<li><a href='https://github.com/scottlnorvell'>Scott</a> adapted xkcd&#8217;s <a href='http://blog.xkcd.com/2012/07/12/a-morbid-python-script/'>actuary.py script</a> to receive input from downloaded Facebook data and return the standard response.</li>

<li>I took my first run at building something on the <a href='http://flask.pocoo.org/'>Flask</a> web framework, along with <a href='https://github.com/mbr/flask-bootstrap'>Flask Bootstrap</a> for formatting.</li>
</ul>

<p>It&#8217;s really amazing how quickly you can discover new tools and techniques when you&#8217;re exploring. Most of the tools listed above were not on the agenda, but they seemed to solve the problems I had or enable us to take the project a step further.</p>

<p>The basic code for downloading data and processing it is <a href='https://github.com/wimsy/actuary'>here</a>, lightly documented (at best) as usual.</p>

<h2 id='the_results'>The results</h2>

<p>When I finally downloaded the data and calculated ages, my 491 or so friends dwindled to 146 in the analysis population. I don&#8217;t know if anything about a person who would suppress a birth year (age) that would necessarily skew the data, but that is certainly a source of potential error.</p>

<p>However, out of that population I was able to derive the following statistical predictions:</p>
<pre>
There is a 5%  chance of someone dying within 0.12 years (by 2013).
There is a 50% chance of someone dying within 1.64 years (by 2014).
There is a 95% chance of someone dying within 5.88 years (by 2018).

There is a 5%  chance of everyone dying within 67.26 years (by 2080).
There is a 50% chance of everyone dying within 72.11 years (by 2085).
There is a 95% chance of everyone dying within 78.3 years (by 2091).

Probability of all dying in 1.0 year: &lt;0.001%
Probability of a death within 1.0 year: 33.50%
</pre>
<p>It&#8217;s kind of scary to think someone I care about has a 50% chance of being gone in 20 short months. It&#8217;s also hard no to ascribe that to a specific person in my mind, although that&#8217;s not strictly valid, given that these numbers reflect the aggregate risk of accidents, premature illness and a whole host of age-related death-dealing ailments.</p>

<h2 id='lifetime_footprints'>Lifetime footprints</h2>

<p>I also wanted to plot the lifetime footprint of my current Facebook friends a la <a href='http://xkcd.com/893/'>xkcd&#8217;s astronaut analysis</a>. Unfortunately, I was unable to find a computationally efficient way to develop an analytical solution, so I fell back to the trusty Monte Carlo simulation. From that, however, I was quickly able to develop &#8220;die-off&#8221; curves at 5%, 50% and 95% probabilities. I also added a &#8220;birth&#8221; curve to describe my Facebook friends coming into the world.</p>

<p><img alt='The living footprint of my Facebook friends' src='/images/wimsy_friends_lifetime_windows.png' /></p>

<p>So, we came into the world beginning in 1937 (with a huge pickup in the 70&#8217;s). And we&#8217;ll all (probably) be gone by 2091. Not a bad run&#8230;</p>

<p>If you want to try it yourself, head on over to <a href='http://wmsy.me/actuarize'>Actuarize</a>, but please be patient. This is a low-volume web app.</p>
