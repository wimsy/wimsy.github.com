<p><em>An engineer-turned-MBA trying to be the anti-quant finally embraces his data-loving self.</em></p>

<p>OK, so why the hell should you read this blog? Well, I&#8217;m not sure you should. This is where I&#8217;m keeping track of my adventures as I reclaim my soul as a quantitative guy from the soft-skills squishy &#8220;strategic&#8221; guy I thought I was for so many years.</p>

<h2 id='what_youll_find_here'>What you&#8217;ll find here</h2>

<p>Hmm&#8230;</p>

<ul>
<li>Musings about how a born-again quant might bring some of the modern tools of advanced analytics to his employer.</li>

<li>Recounting my experiences using data analysis and coding tools, finding and using public data, and developing dtaa-based &#8220;products.&#8221;</li>

<li>Occasional super-fascinating quantitative analysis. Well, to me, anyway. Don&#8217;t expect anything like <a href='http://www.flowingdata.com'>Flowing Data</a> just yet, but I know I fully intend to impress the hell out of myself. And maybe my mom.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id='why_quantary'>Why <em>Quantary</em>?</h2>

<p>Because I&#8217;m the worst punster ever? Because I could register the domain name? I dunno. I hope one of you has a better name.</p>

<p>Or&#8230; well, I suppose the fact that I&#8217;m at a crossroads in my life where the quant in me is about to subsume the anti-quant, one might call that a bit of a quan<span>dt</span>ary (assuming I have any actual control over that process).</p>

<p>Also, I firmly believe that good data analysis is immediately applicable to real-world decision making. You know, to solve the quandaries we face in real life. That doesn&#8217;t mean I can&#8217;t enjoy a trip down an analytical rabbit hole now and then. But we should never forget this point. Never!!!</p>

<h2 id='and_who_am_i'>And who am I?</h2>

<p>Standard story: engineering undergrad + MBA. Technical marketing, brief stint at a startup, then several years of corporate strategy and, now, software development in a very much old-school industry.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not an actual Data Scientist. But despite my concerted effort to distance myself from my quant roots, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever experienced <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology%29'>flow</a> anywhere quite like I do when I have a new data set and I&#8217;m exploring.</p>

<p>So, I&#8217;m investigating what&#8217;s out there. In the past, I&#8217;ve constrained myself to readily available (organized, cleaned) data and whatever I could do in MS Excel. Now, I&#8217;m going to let it loose a bit and see if I can find something amazing.</p>
