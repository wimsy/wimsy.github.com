# Files for blog-building
These files are for building my blog at [wimsy.github.com](http://wimsy.github.com) using the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) project. Rather than over think this blogging thing with a Wordpress site, I thought I'd start the small and hackery way.

The following directories and their contents are copyright Michael Wimsatt. You may not use them or their contents without my permission:

The remainder is heavily leveraged from Github's default "minimal" template and, as such, inherits whatever license they hold over it. Inasmuch as no license applies, the other files and directories are MIT licensed.  Use at your discretion.

I also stole some layout love from @mojombo.
