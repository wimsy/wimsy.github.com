# About Quantary
*An engineer-turned-MBA trying to be the anti-quant finally embraces his data-loving self.*

OK, so why the hell should you read this blog?  Well, I'm not sure you should.  This is where I'm keeping track of my adventures as I reclaim my soul as a quantitative guy from the soft-skills squishy "strategic" guy I thought I was for so many years. 

## What you'll find here
Hmm...
* Musings about how a born-again quant might bring some of the modern tools of advanced analytics to his employer.
* Recounting my experiences using data analysis and coding tools, finding and using public data, and developing dtaa-based "products."
* Occasional super-fascinating quantitative analysis.  Well, to me, anyway.  Don't expect anything like [Flowing Data](http://www.flowingdata.com) just yet, but I know I fully intend to impress the hell out of myself.  And maybe my mom.

## Why *Quantary*?
Because I'm the worst punster ever?  Because I could register the domain name?  I dunno.  I hope one of you has a better name.

Or... well, I suppose the fact that I'm at a crossroads in my life where the quant in me is about to subsume the anti-quant, one might call that a bit of a quan[dt]ary (assuming I have any actual control over that process).  

Also, I firmly believe that good data analysis is immediately applicable to real-world decision making.  You know, to solve the quandaries we face in real life.  That doesn't mean I can't enjoy a trip down an analytical rabbit hole now and then.  But we should never forget this point.  Never!!!

## And who am I?
Standard story: engineering undergrad + MBA.  Technical marketing, brief stint at a startup, then several years of corporate strategy and, now, software development in a very much old-school industry.  

I'm not an actual Data Scientist.  But despite my concerted effort to distance myself from my quant roots, I don't think I've ever experienced [flow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology%29) anywhere quite like I do when I have a new data set and I'm exploring.

So, I'm investigating what's out there.  In the past, I've constrained myself to readily available (organized, cleaned) data and whatever I could do in MS Excel.  Now, I'm going to let it loose a bit and see if I can find something amazing.
